# Wordpress-with-Docker
A wordpress environnement made with docker containers
# How it works
Use the deploiement.ps1 to run the containers or the docker-compose file
There are three lines in the script for making the containers using docker commands:
- A wordpress container ( data are stored in /Conteneur/htmlwordpress )
- A mariadb container ( date are stored in /conteneur/badowordpress )
- A phpmyadmin container
